This code creates a library class that has several methods to manage lending and returning books. The class is initialized with a user-defined name and a list of books. The users can display the available books, lend a book to a user, and return a book to the library. The program runs in a loop, allowing users to interact with the library system by selecting various options. The loop continues until the user chooses to exit the program.
